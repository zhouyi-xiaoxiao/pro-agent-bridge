# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added `codexpro loop-handoff` for bounded local execute/review loops over `.ai-bridge/current-plan.md`, with a required local `--review-command`, `--max-iters`, dry-run preview, optional test command capture, and stop conditions for no diff, repeated diff, missing follow-up plans, reviewer errors, and human cancellation.
- Hardened `loop-handoff` external-command boundaries: commands are preflighted before execution, reviewer verdicts require explicit `CODEXPRO_REVIEW=...` assignment lines by default, and reviewer `PASS` no longer masks failed executor/test/reviewer commands unless the user opts into the supported override behavior.
- Fixed loop change detection so `--stop-if-no-files-changed` and `--stop-if-same-diff` compare each iteration against a pre-execution baseline and count unstaged diffs, staged diffs, and untracked file fingerprints outside `.ai-bridge`.
- Switched loop guard decisions to an uncapped git-state fingerprint instead of hashing or vetoing on the trimmed reviewer diff artifact.
- Kept handoff plan hashing on the handoff read-size budget instead of `--max-output-bytes`, so valid plans larger than captured output excerpts do not abort the loop after execution.
- Made loop change fingerprints content/status based instead of timestamp based, so repeated identical tracked-file writes stop as no new changes instead of looking different because of volatile mtimes.
- Normalized Git porcelain paths back to workspace-relative paths before loop clean-start filtering and change fingerprinting, with path-scoped status and untracked-file scans so nested workspaces inside larger Git repos are handled correctly.
- Bounded untracked file fingerprinting so symlinks are reported via `readlink` and regular files hash only a capped prefix instead of following arbitrary paths or reading entire generated artifacts.
- Tightened `--require-clean-git-start` so staged renames are treated as handoff-only only when both rename endpoints are inside `.ai-bridge`.
- Stopped reviewer `FAIL` and implicit review verdicts from continuing when the reviewer deletes, empties, or restores `.ai-bridge/current-plan.md` to the scaffold instead of writing a usable follow-up plan.
- Kept the autonomous handoff loop CLI-only and local-terminal-owned; it does not expose agent execution as a remote MCP tool, automate ChatGPT Web, approve product prompts, proxy models, or bypass limits.
- Extended handoff smoke coverage with a fake reviewer that fails once by writing a follow-up plan, then passes on the second local executor iteration, plus failed executor, failed reviewer, bare `PASS`, staged-only, untracked-file, bounded-untracked, dirty-baseline, repeated-identical-write, nested-workspace, nested-untracked-workspace, outside-untracked-nested-workspace, large-dirty-baseline, unavailable-diff-artifact, large-plan-over-output-cap, staged-rename, deleted-follow-up-plan, and implicit-deleted-plan cases.

## 0.28.5

- Added a compatibility alias for stale ChatGPT descriptors that still request `ui://widget/codexpro-tool-card-v8.html`, while keeping `ui://widget/codexpro-tool-card-v9.html` as the current advertised widget.
- Stopped advertising the `bash` MCP tool when `CODEXPRO_BASH_MODE=off` / `codexpro start --no-bash` is active, so ChatGPT has less opportunity to attempt a shell tool call in no-bash sessions.
- Stopped advertising direct `write` and `edit` tools unless `CODEXPRO_WRITE_MODE=workspace`; handoff/off modes keep handoff planning tools available for bounded `.ai-bridge` plan files without exposing generic source edit actions.
- Added smoke coverage that compares `codexpro_self_test` expected tools against the actually registered MCP tool set, so disabled tools cannot silently remain visible in ChatGPT's tool list.
- Tightened `CODEXPRO_CONTEXT_DIR` to workspace-relative hidden directories such as `.ai-bridge`, rejecting source/build/dependency/credential directories and absolute paths.
- Made saved profile handling stricter: non-agent modes cannot inherit `write=workspace`, relative tunnel config/token paths resolve from the workspace, and `settings set` refuses to persist raw Cloudflare tunnel tokens.
- Completed the local admin profile form for named Cloudflare/ngrok settings, including tunnel name, config paths, token-file path, and cloudflared auto-install preference.
- Fixed path-scoped `show_changes` so unrelated workspace status is not reported for a clean requested path.
- Kept duplicate `load_skill` matches ambiguous until the caller supplies the exact displayed skill path.
- Added `codexpro_self_test`, a local-only diagnostic that checks modes, expected tools, safe bash policy, selected-only Pro context, and an optional `.ai-bridge/codexpro-self-test.md` write/edit probe without touching source files.
- Upgraded ChatGPT cards to `ui://widget/codexpro-tool-card-v9.html` and attached compact card metadata to every CodexPro tool, with large git/tree/context/bash payloads folded or bounded instead of printed as a giant chat block.
- Added `include_important_files` and `include_changed_files` controls to `export_pro_context` plus CLI smoke coverage for exact selected-only bundles.
- Added a dedicated compact `server_config` renderer and accepted model-friendly aliases `workspace_snapshot.max_files` plus `git_diff.include_diff=false` to reduce avoidable retry/error loops in ChatGPT.
- Reconfirmed the compliance boundary in runtime diagnostics and docs: CodexPro is a local workspace MCP bridge, not a model provider, model proxy, quota bypass, resale layer, or remote executor.
- Added `codexpro start --no-bash` and documented that CodexPro does not bind MCP bash to a Codex app conversation id.
- Added an optional bash session guard with `--bash-session <id> --require-bash-session`; guarded `bash` calls must include the matching `session_id` before any shell command runs.
- Made bash chat transcripts compact by default, with `--bash-transcript full` for the old raw stdout/stderr chat output.
- Added opt-in local Codex session discovery with `--codex-sessions metadata|read`, including session ids, titles, cwd paths, source files, resume commands, and bounded transcript reads only in explicit `read` mode.
- Added a token-protected local profile editor at `/admin/profile` and the setup page so users can save tunnel, hostname, port, mode, bash, Codex session, write/tool mode, widget origin, and tunnel config defaults for the next `codexpro start` without exposing raw tokens in the browser.

## 0.28.4

- Made workspace cards compact by default, moving git details, discovered skills, and optional file tree output behind collapsible disclosure rows.
- Changed workspace open skill discovery to include workspace, user, and plugin skills by default while still exposing a focused `standard` tool surface.
- Added read-only `load_skill` so ChatGPT can load bounded `SKILL.md` instructions for discovered workspace, user, or plugin skills without exposing arbitrary path reads.
- Kept AGENTS detection in the workspace open result but stopped embedding the full AGENTS file in the open response; agents can read it explicitly when needed.
- Fixed setup propagation for `--widget-domain` and corrected workspace-card git status splitting for multi-file diffs.

## 0.28.3

- Added `CODEXPRO_WIDGET_DOMAIN` and the Apps SDK resource metadata keys `_meta.ui.domain` plus `_meta["openai/widgetDomain"]` so ChatGPT no longer reports that the widget domain is missing.
- Surfaced the widget domain in server config, HTTP status output, docs, env examples, and smoke tests.

## 0.28.2

- Moved ChatGPT visual cards from `bash` to the workspace open tools so the first call gives a compact project orientation instead of noisy terminal cards.
- Kept `bash` data-only for focused verification commands and strengthened server instructions to prefer `tree`, `search`, `read`, and `show_changes` for inspection/review.
- Upgraded the widget to v8 with a workspace summary renderer and a neutral waiting state instead of a stale-looking running card.

## 0.28.1

- Added `CODEXPRO_TOOL_MODE=minimal|standard|full`, with `standard` as the default focused ChatGPT tool surface and `full` preserving the previous advanced toolbox.
- Added `show_changes` as a review-oriented visual card for git status, diff stats, and optional diff while keeping raw `git_diff` data-only.
- Upgraded the ChatGPT widget to v7 with compact bash execution summaries, review cards, and cleaner handoff cards.
- Allowed `open_workspace` to accept `path` as an alias for `root` to reduce client argument mismatch failures.
- Allowed safe package scripts with colon suffixes such as `npm run build:clients` for build/test verification.
- Surfaced tool mode in server config, local status, workspace/context exports, launcher output, setup profiles, and docs.

## 0.28.0

- Added `codexpro execute-handoff` as an opt-in local executor for `.ai-bridge/current-plan.md`.
- Added `codexpro watch-handoff` as an opt-in local watcher that executes new handoff plans by content hash without exposing execution as a remote MCP tool.
- Added built-in local adapters for `opencode`, `pi`, and `codex`, plus a restricted `--command` template path for custom agents.
- Added `--dry-run`, `--yes`, timeout handling, stdout/stderr capture, `agent-status.md`, `implementation-diff.patch`, and `execution-log.jsonl` output.
- Kept `handoff_to_agent` planning-only; local execution is not exposed as a remote MCP tool.
- Fixed Windows release-gate coverage for symlink-escape smoke tests, Bash lookup, and custom executor paths containing spaces.
- Added smoke coverage for dry-run previews, custom command validation, execution status, diff collection, duplicate watch-plan skipping, and structured execution logging.
- Clarified that CodexPro is an official Developer Mode/MCP workflow, not a rate-limit bypass or model access provider.

## 0.27.2

- Added `handoff_to_agent` for file-based handoffs to Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or custom local implementation agents without executing local commands.
- Extended `.ai-bridge` with generic `agent-status.md`, `implementation-diff.patch`, and `execution-log.jsonl` files.
- Updated `read_handoff`, `codex_context`, Pro apply logging, docs, and smoke coverage for generic agent handoffs.
- Fixed secret detection so benign env-var references like `process.env.TOKEN` are not blocked or redacted as literal secrets.
- Shell-quoted generated agent command hints so model names cannot inject extra shell tokens.
- Bounded append-mode handoff reads with the configured text-file size guard.

## 0.27.1

- Fail closed when HTTP MCP auth is required but `CODEXPRO_HTTP_TOKEN` is missing, including public tunnel mode and non-loopback binds.
- Block additional safe-bash bypass paths for absolute paths, parent paths, environment expansion, sensitive paths, and `find` write/action flags.
- Added smoke coverage for the missing-token HTTP startup failure and safe-bash blocked command cases.

## 0.27.0

- Kept terminal startup focused on only the connector URL and essential controls; usage prompts now belong in README/docs only.
- Made `git_diff` data-only instead of a widget-rendered tool. This reduces noisy ChatGPT cards and avoids template fetch failures for empty/no-op diffs.
- Kept visual cards scoped to high-signal outputs: source writes, exact edits, Pro context exports, and Codex handoffs.
- Updated smoke coverage so routine inspection tools stay compact.

## 0.26.0

- Removed prompt management from the terminal control panel.
- Removed the `s` hotkey and all launcher-side suggested prompt generation.
- Kept usage prompts and workflow examples in documentation instead of runtime UI.

## 0.25.0

- Simplified the ready screen so startup shows one compact status block instead of a long boxed next-step panel.
- Reduced visible controls to the common actions: open ChatGPT, copy URL, open status, copy prompt, help, and quit.
- Changed the `s` control to copy the suggested ChatGPT prompt instead of printing the full prompt repeatedly.
- Cleaned up saved setup list formatting so reused ngrok/Cloudflare profiles are easier to scan in narrow terminals.

## 0.24.0

- Added `codexpro settings list` to show all saved workspace tunnel profiles.
- Added `codexpro settings use` and `--from-root` to copy a saved setup from one workspace to another.
- Improved first-run `codexpro start` behavior: if the current workspace has no settings but other saved setups exist, CodexPro shows them as a numbered list so users can reuse an existing ngrok or Cloudflare setup instead of retyping hostnames.
- Expanded settings smoke coverage for profile listing and reuse.

## 0.23.0

- Added a compact first-run tunnel picker to `codexpro start` when no workspace settings exist, so users can choose Cloudflare quick, ngrok, Cloudflare stable, or local mode without running the full setup wizard.
- Added `codexpro settings` with `show`, `set`, and `delete --yes` actions for persistent per-workspace tunnel preferences.
- Persisted the selected tunnel provider, hostname, port, mode, and CodexPro token until the user changes or deletes the workspace settings.
- Added `scripts/settings-smoke.mjs` and included it in `npm run smoke`.

## 0.22.0

- Added the v5 Apps SDK widget resource at `ui://widget/codexpro-tool-card-v5.html` with cleaner pending states and more polished diff/search/code cards.
- Added a token-protected local admin dashboard at `/` and `/setup` for workspace, mode, allowed-root, setup, profile, and ChatGPT connection visibility.
- Added the terminal `o` control to open the local admin dashboard while CodexPro is running.
- Updated HTTP smoke coverage to verify the onboarding page and v5 widget resource.

## 0.21.0

- Added `codexpro doctor` as a read-only setup diagnostic for Node, build artifacts, workspace profiles, port availability, tunnel prerequisites, clipboard support, and browser-open support.
- Added `scripts/doctor-smoke.mjs` and included it in `npm run smoke`.
- Added `PUBLIC_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` with release gates, ChatGPT Developer Mode golden prompts, security checks, onboarding expectations, and current non-goals.
- Added `npm run doctor` and included the public launch checklist in the npm package surface.

## 0.20.0

- Made `codexpro setup` prompts clearer with a dim "Enter to proceed with default" hint before each defaulted input.
- Simplified the ready screen: the Server URL is described as already copied, and Enter is clearly labeled as opening ChatGPT connector settings.
- Added saved-profile hints so ngrok/Cloudflare stable setups tell users that future launches from the same workspace only need `codexpro start`.
- Added a local port preflight with clear guidance for running two repositories at the same time.
- Documented the multi-repo rule: each concurrent repo needs its own local port, and stable public tunnels need separate hostnames.

## 0.19.0

- Added per-workspace saved profiles under `~/.codexpro/profiles/`.
- `codexpro setup` now saves tunnel provider, hostname, port, mode, and a generated reusable CodexPro auth token by default.

## 0.17.0

- Added `codexpro setup` / `codexpro onboard` as an interactive onboarding wizard for workspace, port, mode, and public URL strategy.
- Reworked the launcher startup and ready screens into compact framed panels with status lines instead of long setup text.
- Added `npm run connect:setup` for source checkouts.
- Documented the guided onboarding path next to the one-command `codexpro start` flow.

## 0.16.0

- Reworked the widget pre-result state so in-progress tool calls show a compact running card instead of raw placeholder JSON.
- Added `codexpro stable` and `--stable` as shortcuts for Cloudflare named-tunnel mode.
- Added `codexpro stable-help` and friendlier missing-hostname guidance for fixed ChatGPT app URLs.

## 0.15.0

- Changed `codexpro start` to default to agent mode with workspace writes enabled.
- Added `--mode agent`, `--mode handoff`, `--mode pro`, plus shortcut flags `--agent`, `--handoff`, and `--pro-planning`.
- Reworked the terminal startup panel to copy the Server URL, hide long setup details by default, and expose details through controls.
- Updated the default suggested ChatGPT prompt so ChatGPT edits/writes/verifies directly instead of creating a handoff plan.
- Kept handoff and Pro-context workflows as explicit modes for planning-only use.

## 0.14.0

- Added cross-platform `cloudflared` bootstrap for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- CodexPro now reuses `cloudflared` from PATH first, then `~/.codexpro/bin`, then downloads the official Cloudflare release into `~/.codexpro/bin` when needed.
- Changed `--install-cloudflared` to force a user-local reinstall instead of using Homebrew.

- Updated setup docs with OS-specific notes for clipboard, browser opening, and Cloudflare Tunnel.

## 0.13.0

- Added an interactive CodexPro terminal control panel after startup.
- Added Enter-to-open ChatGPT connector settings, `c` to copy URL, `p` to print app fields, `s` to print the suggested prompt, and `q` to stop.
- Quieted local MCP and Cloudflare logs by default so startup reads like a product flow.
- Made macOS/Homebrew `cloudflared` installation automatic by default when missing.
- Added `--no-install-cloudflared` to opt out of automatic installation.
- Changed the default user-facing start command to `npx codexpro@latest start`.
